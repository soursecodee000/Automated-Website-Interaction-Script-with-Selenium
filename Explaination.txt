This Python script uses the Selenium library to automate interactions with a website, 
specifically to open a webpage, wait for a video to start playing, click a button on the page, 
and play the video for a random duration between 30 seconds and 1.5 minutes. 
The process is repeated 1000 times for a list of URLs read from a text file.

Let's break down the script:

Importing Libraries:

time: Used for time-related operations.
traceback: Used for printing detailed error information in case of exceptions.
webdriver and related modules from Selenium: Used for browser automation.
ChromeService and ChromeOptions: Used for configuring the ChromeDriver service and options.
By: Used for locating elements on a webpage.
WebDriverWait and expected_conditions: Used for waiting until certain conditions are met before proceeding.
ChromeDriverManager: Used for automatically downloading and managing the ChromeDriver executable.
automate_website Function:

Accepts a URL as an argument.
Sets up the ChromeDriver service and options.
Opens the specified URL in a Chrome browser.
Waits for the video to start playing (a sleep time of 60 seconds is set, which can be adjusted).
Locates a button on the webpage with a specific ID and clicks it.
Plays the video for a random duration between 30 seconds and 1.5 minutes.
Catches and prints any exceptions that might occur during this process.
Closes the browser window in the finally block.
Read Links from a Text File:

Opens a text file named 'Links_list.txt' and reads each line, storing them in a list called links.
Repeat the Process:

The main loop iterates 1000 times.
For each iteration, it goes through the list of links obtained from the text file and calls the automate_website function for each link.
Note: This script assumes that the webpage structure and elements (like the video, button with a specific ID) are present on the target website. It also depends on external factors, such as the stability of the website and the reliability of the network, which might affect the automation process. Additionally, web scraping and automation should be done responsibly and in compliance with the website's terms of service.
